title: Phoenix Software Engineering Reading Group at Gangplank
---
We're a group of Phoenix-area software engineers and developers! We meet every other week at [Gangplank in Chandler][gangplank]. 

> We believe there's more to programming than punching a clock and keeping status quo. We put thought and craft into our work and treat constant learning as a first principle. If you care about the code you write and love to learn with others, join us!

Find out more by visiting [Phoenix Software Engineering Reading Group on meetup.com][meetup].
