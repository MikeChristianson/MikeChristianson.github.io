We're an open group of Phoenix-area software engineers and developers! We meet [weekly on Wednesday nights from 8pm to 10pm at Gangplank in Chandler](#where).

Questions? [Send me a message][1]{: class="btn" style="margin-left: 2em;"}

### Current book

*[Good Math: A Geek's Guide to the Beauty of Numbers, Logic, and Computation][2]*

### How does it work?

We read an agreed upon portion of the book on our own, then meet the following week to discuss what we've read. Occasionally we take turns presenting. <a name="where" />

### Where do you meet?

Our group meets at [Gangplank Chandler][3] in the *Burgundy Lounge*, the first conference room on the right toward the rear of the building. Just ask someone to point you in the right direction if you need help finding us.

### Is the group right for me?

The group is focused on professional development for software engineers and developers. You should review the list of our [previously read books](#past-books) and judge your skill and experience accordingly. If you are new to programming or are a student, you may be better served by a study group made of your peers.

### Should I wait until you start a new book?

It depends on the book. But, really, it's up to you.
