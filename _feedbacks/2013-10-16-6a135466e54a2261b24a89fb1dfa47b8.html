    mjames@wiley.com\nWebsite: http://www.wrox.com\nComment: Hi Michael,\r\n\r\nI’m
    an acquisitions editor at Wiley Publishers, where I sign developer titles in the
    Wrox imprint (www.wrox.com). \r\n\r\nI am looking for authors for a few Java related
    books, including one on concurrency (one that would complement, not compete with,
    Java Concurrency in Practice).  I have one or two people interested, and I’m wondering
    if this is something you’d be interested in discussing this with them, as a potential
    author team?  \r\n\r\nFor these books, Wrox is collaborating with InnerWorkings,
    a company that creates patented e-training modules for enterprise environments
    (www.innerworkings.com).  They have worked with Fortune 500 companies around the
    world.  The modules would be created alongside the book content, while the author
    is writing, ultimately giving the book extra reach into the vast enterprise training
    market.  \r\n\r\nI’m happy to tell you more – I just wanted to gauge your interest
    first.\r\n\r\nThanks for your time and I hope to hear from you!\r\n\r\nMary E.
