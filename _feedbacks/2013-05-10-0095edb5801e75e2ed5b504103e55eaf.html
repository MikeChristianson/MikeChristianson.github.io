    http://wwww.packtpub.com\nComment: Hi Mike\r\n\r\nMy name is Dyson D' Souza and
    I work for Packt Publishing, a UK-based publishing company specializing in focused
    IT books. We have recently published a book on Clojure Data Analysis Cookbook,
    and I was wondering if you'd be interested in taking a look at the book and sharing
    your comments on your blog and on Amazon. \r\n\r\nI'm contacting you because I'm
    aware that you share good knowledge in the subject this book covers, and so believe
    that your comments would be important for both consumers and readers alike. For
    this, I'd be glad to offer you a digital copy of the book. \r\n\r\nA few details
    about the book: it composes of 342 pages, create beautiful, insightful graphs
    that you can publish to the Internet, apply powerful clustering and data mining
    techniques to better understand your data, Use powerful data analysis libraries
    like Incanter, Hadoop, and Weka to get things done quickly. For more information
    please visit this link:  http://www.packtpub.com/clojure-data-analysis-cookbook/book
    \r\n\r\nWould be great to hear from you. Thank you.\r\n\r\nKind regards, \r\n\r\nDyson
