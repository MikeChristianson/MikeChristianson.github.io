Matt\'s code had an almost sentence-like simplicity to it -- pithy but expressive -- that impressed me. As we walked through how the program worked, I couldn\'t help but wonder about a Java implementation. So, I [wrote one][2]. Matt\'s is self-contained in one file while mine is split across multiple files. (I opted to not use anonymous/inner classes.) I think we were a bit surprised that the concurrency logic is similar and the \"main\" driving section of each implementation follows the same set-up procedure. Perhaps my code was influenced by way of transliteration? I\'m struck by how Matt\'s Clojure programs reads somewhat like a story while my Java program reads like instructions for a computer.
