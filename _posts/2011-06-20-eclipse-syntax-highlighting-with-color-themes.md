By default, Eclipse does a pretty good job of syntax highlighting Java files without going overboard. But, if you want a fresh look -- maybe you want to try a dark background -- the Eclipse Color Theme plugin lets you change whole editor themes with the click of your mouse. The [Eclipse Color Theme][1] plugin is free and so are the themes. So far I\'m liking the [dark Oblivion theme][2], shown below.
