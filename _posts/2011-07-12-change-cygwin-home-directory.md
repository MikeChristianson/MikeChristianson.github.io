One is their Windows home directory (<tt>%USERPROFILE%</tt>) and the other is their Cygwin home directory (<tt>~</tt>). Several months ago I became frustrated with repeated navigation from one to the other, so I began using a symbolic link. In <tt>~</tt> I created a link to <tt>%USERPROFILE%</tt> with&nbsp;`ln -s "$USERPROFILE" home`. Thus, any time I wanted to change to my Windows home directory I would simply <tt>cd ~/home</tt>. It worked, but that&nbsp;dichotomy remainedâ€¦ Then, it&nbsp;occurred&nbsp;to me: why couldn\'t <tt>~</tt> and <tt>%USERPROFILE%</tt> be the same? Luckily, they can! &nbsp;In fact, the [Cygwin documentation on alternate home roots][1] shows exactly how. Using <tt>[mkpasswd][2]</tt>, one or all home directories may be set to any arbitrary path; to change all home directories to the Windows home directory:     mkpasswd -l -p "$(cygpath -H)" > /etc/passwd
{: lang="bash"}

 Pretty neat. See&nbsp;the [Cygwin documentation on alternate home roots][1] for more information.
