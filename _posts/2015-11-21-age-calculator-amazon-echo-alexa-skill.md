After further refinement, and a few rounds of helpful feedback from the Alexa Skills team, my Age Calculator is certified and available for use by any Amazon Echo user! 

To recap [the prior post][prior-post], my Skill helps calculate age between a given date and now.

> The Age Calculator helps you calculate age between now and a given date, whether in the past or future. Depending on the length of time, it will provide the number of days, months, or years, as appropriate. When the year is unspecified, the next year will be used by default.

If you'd like to try out my Age Calculator, look for it in the [Skills list within the Alexa app][skills].
