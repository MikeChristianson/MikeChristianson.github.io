--- layout: post title: Remote debugging categories: - java tags: - debugging - java status: publish type: post published: true meta: \_edit\_last: \'2\' \_wp\_old\_slug: java-remote-debugging simplecatch-sidebarlayout: \'\' --- I never knew how good life could be -- at work, mind you -- until I spent some quality time with the Eclipse debugger.  My days of relying solely on [<tt>System.out.println()</tt>][1] are long gone.  Print debugging is only useful if you can change the code.  Loggers like [Log4j][2] are only marginally better -- assuming the code uses it properly in the first place. And things get more interesting when the code is running on a different or remote machine.  Luckily, Java has a great remote debugging facility. Here\'s an example of how I enable remote debugging using command-line arguments. `-agentlib:jdwp=transport=dt_socket,address=8000,server=y,suspend=n` In this example, the remote application will start and run normally while listening in the background for a debugger to connect on port 8000.  For further details on how to enable and configure remote debugging, see Sun\'s [JPDA Connection and Invocation][3] guide.
