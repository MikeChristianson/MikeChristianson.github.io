This book was my personal choice, kindly agreed to by the other members of the group. Everyone seems toÂ enjoy the book thus far, even when I presented chapters four and five this week!

If you're in the Phoenix area, come join us! Drop by <a href="http://gangplankhq.com/">Gangplank</a> at 8:00pm on any Wednesday.
