I now have a <a href="https://github.com/MikeChristianson">githubÂ account</a>, mostly to learn about github and, of course, git.

<a href="https://github.com/MikeChristianson">https://github.com/MikeChristianson</a>

There I have a three repositories: one for code created while reading through TDD by Example, one for testing assumptions about how Java behaves, and the last is some quick-and-dirty code I wrote over a year ago to scrape the signal status page of my cable modem.

Github will also help me keep track of code I'm writing with/for/during my <a href="http://gangplankhq.com/2011/06/software-engineering-reading-group/">software engineering reading group hosted at Gangplank</a>.

Git is pretty weird for someone like me who has gone from <em>Visual SourceSafe</em> to <em>Perforce</em> to <em>Subversion</em>. (You can blame it on the centralized nature of those version control systems if you'd like.) Six years ago I fell in love with the simplicity of Subversion but I must admit the distributed nature of git is enticing.

When possible, I try to check in small units of work. That's sometimes difficult with svn, if you're changing a lot of files but don't really want to make one-big-commit. But git is ready for the challenge (<em>commit, commit, commit, ..., push</em>).

I won't get into using Eclipse with git/github. They weren't really made for each other and it shows.
