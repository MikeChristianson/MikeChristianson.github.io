JetBrains has released [IntelliJ IDEA 13][1] and, after discussing some of its new features with a friend, I decided to try the new Terminal tool window.

You mean I have to use the default Windows command interface? Oh, the humanity. 

I develop on Windows (out of IT necessity) but use Cygwin for my terminal. What to do? Aha! Change the `Terminal Shell path` configuration! 

Let's use Cygwin's zsh.exe instead. (You could probably substitute `cmd.exe` for `powershell.exe`, too, if that's your thing.)

Phew. That's better. Sure glad they made that
configurable.
