SeaFlow displays vehicle speeds, density, and count metrics.  (WSDOT\'s map shows only density which is certainly useful, but not a complete picture.)  The visual color representation of each metric can be customized in SeaFlow. In times of peak demand, such as [December 18, 2008][4], WSDOT\'s website may become overwhelemed and yield partial or missing maps.  SeaFlow\'s use of the smaller WSDOT data file -- with maps rendered on the client-side -- reduces demand on WSDOT\'s site and can provide more reliable and complete updates. [SeaFlow][2] is a great Java desktop app -- small, efficient, and cross-platform.  Its license is [GPL][5].
