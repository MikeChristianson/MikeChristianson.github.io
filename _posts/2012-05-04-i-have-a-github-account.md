--- layout: post title: I have a github account categories: - git - github tags: \[\] status: publish type: post published: true meta: \_edit\_last: \'2\' simplecatch-sidebarlayout: \'\' --- I now have a [githubÂ account][1], mostly to learn about github and, of course, git. [https://github.com/MikeChristianson][1] There I have a three repositories: one for code created while reading through TDD by Example, one for testing assumptions about how Java behaves, and the last is some quick-and-dirty code I wrote over a year ago to scrape the signal status page of my cable modem. Github will also help me keep track of code I\'m writing with/for/during my [software engineering reading group hosted at Gangplank][2]. Git is pretty weird for someone like me who has gone from *Visual SourceSafe* to *Perforce* to *Subversion*. (You can blame it on the centralized nature of those version control systems if you\'d like.) Six years ago I fell in love with the simplicity of Subversion but I must admit the distributed nature of git is enticing. When possible, I try to check in small units of work. That\'s sometimes difficult with svn, if you\'re changing a lot of files but don\'t really want to make one-big-commit. But git is ready for the challenge (*commit, commit, commit, ..., push*). I won\'t get into using Eclipse with git/github. They weren\'t really made for each other and it shows.
