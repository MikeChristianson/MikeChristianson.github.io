Certainly I'm not the first to notice the similarity between Test Driven Development and the Scientific Method? Answering my question: nope! Looks like a bunch of <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=tdd+scientific+method">smart people have also made the connection</a>. My favorite observation on the topic: the Scientific Method can be used as motivation for using TDD. Certainly a clever approach for introducing TDD to a scientifically-minded person.
