 Let\'s face it, cygwin is neat but the console (or, terminal emulator, if you prefer) it launches is *lame*. I\'m not referring to bash, but rather the normal -- and thus lame -- Windows command box. Things just don\'t feel right... some keys don\'t work as expected and forget about making the window wider. Fortunately, there is a better way! Rather, I should say there are better way*s*\: [puttycyg][2],&nbsp;[Console2][3], and my personal favorite,&nbsp;[mintty][4]. [![](http://www.smugmug.com/photos/770506088_uoPhz-S.png "mintty screenshot"){: .aligncenter width="400" height="269"}][5] [puttycyg][2] is a patched version of [putty][6] with support for cygwin. [mintty][4] is ... well, yeah, it\'s based on putty, too. If you use cygwin, you owe it to yourself to try one or all of them immediately. And by that I mean stop reading and start downloading. Now.
