JetBrains has released <a href="https://codeaweso.me/_/hq7jn">IntelliJ IDEA 13</a> and, after discussing some of its new features with a friend, I decided to try the new Terminal tool window.

You mean I have to use the default Windows command interface? Oh, the humanity.

I develop on Windows (out of IT necessity) but use Cygwin for my terminal. What to do? Aha! Change the "Terminal Shell path" configuration! Let's use Cygwin's zsh.exe instead. (You could probably substitute cmd.exe for powershell.exe, too, if that's your thing.)<!--more-->

Sure glad they made that configurable.<img class="aligncenter" alt="" src="http://www.smugmug.com/photos/i-dmhKDNj/0/O/i-dmhKDNj.png" width="381" height="177" /></p>
