Following <a href="http://www.javaposse.com/index.php?post_id=314840">Java Posse Roundup 2008</a>, Bruce Eckel wrote an excellent article outlining <a href="http://www.artima.com/weblogs/viewpost.jsp?thread=228097">six things that you should test for when hiring someone</a>.  It contains the collective wisdom of the conference attendees, as articulated by Bruce, which I could not hope to improve upon.

The original points are numbered, one through six, but are not listed in any particular order.  Were I to give them an order based on importance, they would be arranged as follows.
<ol>
	<li>Are you toxic?</li>
	<li>Can you learn?  Can you solve problems?</li>
	<li>Critical thinking.  Can you change?</li>
	<li>Technical knowledge.</li>
</ol>
Ok, I cheated; it's hard to put them in an absolute order.  All are important and relate to each other in some manner.  All software developers -- and managers thereof -- should read the original!
